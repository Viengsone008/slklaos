This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

### Quick Deploy Steps:

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
2. Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up/login
3. Click "New Project" and import your repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect it's a Next.js project
5. Click "Deploy" - that's it!

Your app will be deployed and you'll get a live URL. Vercel automatically handles:

- ✅ Build optimization
- ✅ Automatic deployments on git push
- ✅ Preview deployments for pull requests
- ✅ Edge functions and serverless API routes
- ✅ Built-in analytics and performance monitoring
